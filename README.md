# Go For A Punch Time Line
The repo is for hosting the files and content of the Timeline page of Go For A Punch. (I'll be more efficient soon)


P.S. I know a lot of devs are probably yelling on how this could be improved by a lot but I did it this way because it'd be better for archiving content on the page.
